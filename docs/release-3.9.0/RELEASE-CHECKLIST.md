# SORA Wallet Android 3.9.0: release checklist

Human and operations actions for the release. Each task adds its items here.

## a1: Retired qualification gates, lean CI

### GitHub secrets and settings

Create a GitHub environment named `production` with required reviewers, and
store these secrets in it. The values come from the Jenkins credentials that
signed 3.8.6.3. Never commit them or paste them into an issue or chat.

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `CI_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | The upload keystore file (Jenkins credential `android_keystore_sora`) as one line of base64, e.g. `base64 < upload.keystore \| tr -d '\n'`. |
| `CI_KEYSTORE_PASS` | Keystore password (Jenkins `android_keystore_storepass_sora`). |
| `CI_KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias (Jenkins `android_keyalias_sora`). |
| `CI_KEYSTORE_KEY_PASS` | Key password (Jenkins `android_keypass_sora`). |
| `SORA_GOOGLE_TOKEN_PROD` | The Google Drive backup OAuth client ID used by 3.8.6.3. It must be the same client in the same Google Cloud project, or users will not see their existing Drive backups. |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` | `google-services.json` for `jp.co.soramitsu.sora` as one line of base64. Jenkins decrypts it from `app/google-services.json.gpg`. Without it Crashlytics is off. |

Version code: pass it as the `version_code` input when starting the workflow
(preferred). For tag-triggered runs, set a repository or environment variable
(or secret) `SORA_VERSION_CODE`.

- [ ] Create the `production` environment with required reviewers and add the
      six secrets above.
- [ ] Confirm the highest versionCode already uploaded to Google Play for
      `jp.co.soramitsu.sora`, including internal, closed and open testing
      tracks. It is believed to be 122 (3.8.6.3). Use a higher code; the
      recommendation for 3.9.0 is `3090001`.
- [ ] Merge `.github/workflows/android_release.yml` to the default branch
      (`modernize`) so "Android Release" can be started from the Actions tab.
      Until then, push a tag such as `android/v3.9.0` on the release commit:
      tag runs use the workflow file from that commit and take the version code
      from `SORA_VERSION_CODE`.
- [ ] Branch protection on `modernize` and `master`: remove the old required
      checks "Modernization Source and Unit Tests", "Explorer Contracts" and
      "Block Explorer Connected Test". Require "Unit tests (productionDebug)"
      and "Build, lint and 16 KB check" from `Android CI`.
- [ ] Watch the first `Android CI` run of the release branch. Lint could not
      be run on the offline build machine (the lint tool is not in its Gradle
      cache), so this is the first lint result for these changes. Fix any new
      lint errors; update `app/lint-baseline.xml` only when a finding cannot
      be fixed, and say so in the pull request.
- [ ] Optional cleanup: delete the secrets and variables that only the retired
      qualification workflow read: `ANDROID_DEPENDENCY_SIGNING_REVIEW_*`,
      `ANDROID_MIGRATION_QUALIFICATION_*`, `ANDROID_MIGRATION_CONTROLLER_*`,
      `TAIRA_DEPLOYMENT_*`, `PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_*`, `PRODUCTION_PI_CONTROLLER_ID`,
      `FUNDED_CANARY_*`, `POLKAMARKT_EXTRINSIC_*`, `POLKAMARKT_IOS_*`,
      `POLKAMARKT_IOS_READ_TOKEN` and the variable `PRODUCTION_VERSION_CODE`.

### Jenkins

- [ ] Confirm what the shared `AppPipeline` (`publishType: 'Bundle'`) builds and
      publishes on each branch. It must not upload a productionRelease bundle
      to Google Play; signed Play builds now come from "Android Release".
- [ ] Jenkins now also runs `testProductionDebugUnitTest`. Expect the test stage
      to take longer.

### Build the release

- [ ] Start "Android Release" on the release commit with `version_code`
      (e.g. `3090001`). Approve the `production` environment.
- [ ] Check the run: every blocking step is green, "Check package name and version" shows
      `versionName='3.9.0'` and the requested versionCode, and "Check signing
      certificate" reports `b35dfe16cb3226da4432607288c6287362c5e623532c428f933d552297e9e3e0`
      for both the AAB and the APK.
- [ ] If the run shows the warning "lintProductionDebug failed", read
      `lint-results-productionDebug.html` in the artifact and decide whether
      to fix the findings before uploading.
- [ ] Download the `sora-android-release-<versionCode>` artifact and check it
      with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt`. Keep `mapping.txt` with the release.
- [ ] Upload the AAB to the Play Console internal track by hand. In the Play
      Console, confirm that the upload key is accepted and that App Signing shows
      the same certificate.

### Device checks before rollout

- [ ] Install the signed release APK on real arm64 phones (and one 32-bit
      armeabi-v7a phone if available) over an existing 3.8.6.3 install with
      wallets. Check that every account opens with the same address and
      balance, and that a transfer signs. CI only builds and checks the
      artifacts; it does not run the release APK on a device.
- [ ] Optional, on an emulator (never on a phone with real wallets):
      `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 bash scripts/run-production-connected-device-qualification.sh`
      runs the wallet-upgrade device tests.

### Rollout

- [ ] Staged rollout in the Play Console (for example 1%, 5%, 25%, 100%),
      watching Crashlytics crash and ANR rates between steps. The retired
      `verifyProductionRollout` gate no longer does this.
